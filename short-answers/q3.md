# Question

Where do html attributes go?

# Answer

Attributes add additional information about an element and are listed in the opening tag. Some examples of these tags are `src`, and `alt`. `src` attributes are the links or the media source, and `alt` attributes are the descriptions of what the `src` attributes contain.
